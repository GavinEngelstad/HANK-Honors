The variance shares of the model give a good general idea of which factors contribute to changes in macroeconomic aggregates and household decisions, however they do not give any specific view of which shocks and factors have been important over time. To analyze this, I perform a historical decomposition of the shocks to the model using the same macroeconomic series as the Bayesian estimation.


\subsection{Decomposition Strategy}

To perform the historical decomposition, I use the process in \textcite{auclert2023estimating}. Using the deviation from trend in the observed data $d\mathbf{X}^\text{data}$ and the IRFs of the model $d \mathbf{X}$, I solve for a matrix of shocks $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ that create simulated paths for macroeconomic series $d \tilde{\mathbf{X}}$ to solve
\begin{align*}
    \min_{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}} \quad & \sum_{t = 0}^{T_\text{obs}} \left\| d\mathbf{X}_t^\text{data} - d \tilde{\mathbf{X}_t} \right\|^2 \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & d \tilde{\mathbf{X}}_t = \sum_{s = 0}^{T-1} d\mathbf{X}_s \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{t-s}.
\end{align*}
Since I use seven data series to fit seven shocks that all have linearly independent IRFs, the sequences for shocks $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ when simulated $d \tilde{\mathbf{X}}_t$ perfectly match the data. Using the sequences for shocks in $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$, the simulated $d \tilde{\mathbf{X}}_t$ can be decomposed as the sum of the effects from each individual shock. Figure \ref{fig:fit-hist-decomp} shows the decompositions for each of the fitted data series.

Then, I use the sequences of shocks to simulate the behavior of different households over time within the model. These series are pure simulation and not fit to any microdata, so they should not be taken as true paths for the consumption and savings decisions for actual households. Therefore, I interpret these sequences more weakly to get insight into the factors affecting household decisions. In addition, I apply a moving average to better get at general trends and reduce noise.


\subsection{Historical Decompositions}

The historical decompositions for aggregate consumption and savings are presented in Figure \ref{fig:agg-hist-decomp}. Like in the variance decompositions, price and wage markup shocks have been the most important determinants of consumption. In contrast, many factors, including wage markups, monetary policy, and transfers, impact aggregate savings.

    \label{fig:agg-hist-decomp}
\end{figure}

Looking at specific time periods, price markups increase consumption initially while wage markups decrease consumption. Then, in the 80s the two effects flip-flop and price markups start to decrease consumption while wage markups increase it. Finally, around the time of the Great Recession the two effects switch again until the end of the estimation window. Across almost all periods, the effects from wage markups are slightly stronger than those of price markups, consistent with the variance decomposition in Figure \ref{subfig:hh-agg-aggs}. Instead of price markups, transfers and monetary policy have significant impacts on savings, but the direction of the effects again flips in the early 1980s and late 2000s.

    \label{fig:cons-hist-decomp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cons-hist-decomp} has historical decompositions for consumption decisions for households across the income and wealth distribution. Like in Section \ref{sec:buis-cycs}, I focus on low, middle, and high income households at the 0th, 50th, 90th, and 99th wealth percentiles. Simulated paths for consumption are very different for households at the 0th wealth percentile than other points along the wealth distribution, which all look very similar. Specifically, low wealth households are affected by a more diverse array of shocks, while the consumption patterns for higher wealth households are almost entirely explained by price and wage markups. Wage markup shocks impact low income households more than price markups, though for high income households price markup shocks are more important.

Tax progressivity shocks have opposite effects on low and high income households --- when tax progressivity shocks cause low income households to consume more they cause high income households to consume less. Despite the decomposition only being fit on aggregate data, the effects of the Reagan-era tax cuts for higher income households are clear within the decomposition \autocite{prasad2012popular}. Before the 80s when the top marginal tax rate in the US was highest, the level of tax progressivity makes higher income households consume less, and it makes lower and middle income households consume more. After the 80s, this flips and tax progressivity has positive effects on the consumption of high income households and negative effects on the consumption of low and middle income households. This lends credence to the use of shock paths fitted on aggregate data to gain understanding of individual-level phenomena within the model.

A similar decomposition for savings decisions is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sav-hist-decomp}. Low and middle income households at the 0th wealth percentile never save, and therefore the decomposition is constant over time. Low and middle income households at other wealth levels do have some variability in their savings decisions, though substantially less than higher income households. This contrasts the consumption decomposition in Figure \ref{fig:cons-hist-decomp}, where within a wealth band consumption has similar variability at all income levels. Price markups and tax progressivity are most important for low income households' savings decisions. Middle income household saving is similarly affected by price markups and tax progressivity though also face significant wage markup effects. Changes in savings decisions for high income households, especially at higher wealth levels, are almost entirely caused by wage markup shocks.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Historical Decomposition of Endogenous Effects}

To get a more precise view of what specific macroeconomic factors households respond to, not just the overall macroeconomic shocks, I separate the decomposed paths into the direct factors that play into household decisions. Like outlined in Section \ref{sec:endog-eff}, shocks affect households through labor supply, wages, interest rates, transfers, and taxes. Therefore, paths for aggregate and household consumption and saving can be explained as the sum of the effects from each of these sources.

Figure \ref{fig:agg-endog-hist-decomp} shows the effect of each of these channels on aggregate consumption and saving. The specific paths for both series are identical to those in Figure \ref{fig:agg-hist-decomp}. Wages and transfers, which move inverse to each other, are the most significant factors affecting consumption, though the labor supply decided by the union also plays an important role. In fact, the transfer and wage effects almost perfectly cancel each other out, so the overall series very nearly follows the path caused by changes in labor supply. Interest rates and taxes have minimal effects on aggregate consumption within the window.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \caption{Historical Endogenous Decomposition: Household Aggregates}
    \input{figures/endog_agg_historical_decomp.pgf}

    {\scriptsize \emph{Notes:} NBER-dated recessions highlighted in gray.}
    \label{fig:agg-endog-hist-decomp}
\end{figure}

Wages, interest rates, and taxes are the most important determinants of aggregate savings. Likely due to the $\rho_B$ parameter in the bond law of motion, the decomposed factors appear much smoother for savings than consumption, but the general shape of the savings decomposition is similar to that of the consumption decomposition, especially for the wage effects. Interest rates and taxes are far more important for savings than for consumption. The difference between the effects of taxes on consumption and savings suggests households in the model that were given tax breaks within the estimation window chose to save the extra money, not spend it. This could be because the largest tax breaks in the estimation window were given to higher wealth households, which have lower MPCs \autocite{auclert2023mpcs}.

The decomposition separated by income and wealth level is presented in Figure \ref{fig:cons-endog-hist-decomp}. The labor supply choice is, in general, the most important factor affecting household consumption decisions, especially for higher income or higher wealth households. For lower income and lower wealth households, direct household transfers and taxes are also important. Wages and interest rates are moderately important to all households except low and middle income 0th percentile households that are never impacted by the interest rate.

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \caption{Historical Endogenous Decomposition: Household Consumption}
    \input{figures/endog_c_historical_decomp.pgf}

    {\scriptsize \emph{Notes:} Row labeled by wealth percentile. 12 quarter moving average applied. NBER-dated recessions highlighted in gray.}
    \label{fig:cons-endog-hist-decomp}
\end{figure}

Especially at higher wealth levels, the simulated paths for consumption are very similar within a wealth band. However, higher income households face larger, conflicting effects from individual shocks. Therefore, even when the observed decisions are the same, there can be substantial heterogeneity in the specific factors causing households to make those decisions emphasizing the importance of this type of decomposition for understanding the underlying mechanisms within the economy. 

Figure \ref{fig:sav-endog-hist-decomp} presents the same decomposition for household savings decisions. Again, low and middle income households at the 0th wealth percentile never choose to save. Interest rates are moderately important across all households, but most important to higher wealth households. In fact, interest rates determine almost all movement in savings decisions for 99th percentile low and middle income households. Households with either lower levels of wealth or higher income also face significant wage, labor, and tax effects. This suggests households choose to save more to consumption smooth after changes in income rather than to increase their future earnings when interest rates are higher, since shifts in the interest rate would have the largest impact on the incomes of the most affected groups while the potential changes in future income would impact all households.

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \caption{Historical Endogenous Decomposition: Household Savings}
    \input{figures/endog_a_historical_decomp.pgf}

    {\scriptsize \emph{Notes:} Row labeled by wealth percentile. 12 quarter moving average applied. NBER-dated recessions highlighted in gray.}
    \label{fig:sav-endog-hist-decomp}
\end{figure}

Since the simulated paths are the same, this decomposition shows more variability in the savings decisions for high income households than low or middle income households like in Figure \ref{fig:sav-hist-decomp}. The important factors affecting the decisions of low and middle income households are very unidirectional. The different effects, for the most part, cause these households to either only save more or less. In contrast, higher income households face diverging effects that in part cancel each other out.
