The significant cross-sectional differences between households in the United States suggests business cycle fluctuations should have heterogeneous effects across households. At the same time, most macroeconomic research, both within representative agent and heterogeneous models, is interested in explaining changes in aggregates \autocites{smets2007shocks}{krusell1998income}{kaplan2018monetary}{auclert2019monetary}{mckay2016power}. I examine how business cycles affect households at different wealth and income levels. I also examine the important transmission channels for changes in behavior for different households. I find substantial variation in household consumption decisions across the income distribution and in household savings decisions across the wealth distribution.

I analyze these effects within the framework of an estimated Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. HANK models add household heterogeneity to standard New Keynesian models that feature price and market frictions \autocite{kaplan2018monetary}. The model features incomplete markets and uninsurable risks that give households a strong precautionary motive that plays an important role in the economy \autocites{mckay2016power}{bayer2019precautionary}. My model follows the standard within HANK literature and features an idiosyncratic productivity process for households that determines their income potential \autocites{kaplan2018monetary}{mckay2016power}. Within the model, households decide how much to consume and save, which determines their movements along the wealth distribution.

To understand the effect of business cycles on the model, I perform a Bayesian estimation against US data from 1966 to 2019 of seven macroeconomic shocks to the model: total factor productivity (TFP), price markups, wage markups, government spending, monetary policy, government transfers to households, and tax progressivity. The first five shocks are chosen from representative agent literature as structural shocks to aggregates in the model \autocite{smets2007shocks}. The tax progressivity shock is unique to heterogeneous models and applies non-uniformly across the distribution of households \autocite{bayer2024shocks}. The household transfer shock does the opposite, applying a uniform shock to all households. My estimations suggest price and wage markups  as well as tax progressivity and transfers play the most important role explaining the changes in aggregate outcomes during business cycles.

Given my estimates, I then examine the effect of business cycles on household decisions at different productivity and wealth levels. This goes one step farther than other Bayesian estimates of HANKs in the literature that typically focus on aggregates \autocites{auclert2020micro}{acharya2023estimating} or macro-level movements of the wealth distribution \autocites{bayer2024shocks}. I find that business cycle driven changes in household decisions are caused by a combination of price and wage markups, tax progressivity, government spending, monetary policy, and household transfers. Price and wage markups are especially important for household consumption decisions, with wage markup shocks affecting lower income households the most and price markup shocks affecting higher income households the most. Monetary policy is most important for explaining higher wealth households savings decisions while government spending, tax progressivity, and transfers are the main drivers of variation in savings decisions for lower wealth households. 

Then, I expand the direct-indirect effects decomposition from \textcite{kaplan2018monetary} to all factors that directly affect household decisions in my model: labor supply, wages, interest rates, transfers, and taxes. Using this decomposition, I analyze which macroeconomic factors that directly play into household decisions are the most important for households at different locations along the wealth and productivity distributions. I find that interest rates are most important for high income households' saving and consumption decisions. Labor supply and transfers are the primary determinants of low and middle income household consumption decisions and the interest rate has the largest effects on their savings decisions. Within business cycles, the comovement of factors affecting lower income households cause diverging effects on consumption and unidirectional effects on saving. Higher income households are the opposite; factor comovement has harmonious consumption effects and clashing savings effects.

Finally, I use a historical decomposition to analyze the important factors over time. Similar to the variance decompositions, the historical decomposition points to price and wage markups through their labor supply and transfer effects being the key drivers of household consumption decisions, with price markups being more important only for higher income households. Savings decisions are most affected by interest rates, markups, and taxes. Due to the progressive tax scheme in the model and inclusion of a tax progressivity shock, the tax channel especially highlights differences in how households across the wealth and income distribution make decisions.
