% Except for tax progressivity and government transfers, household behavior within the model is not a direct response to shocks, but rather a response to the macroeconomic consequences of the shock. In this section, I decompose the variance in household decisions into the different direct channels that affect household decisions. Within the framework of my estimated HANK, this analysis pinpoints the most important macroeconomic factors for different households.

% \subsection{Direct Effects Decomposition}
% I expand the direct-indirect decomposition for monetary policy shocks from \textcite{kaplan2018monetary} to the full set of shocks and direct household effects within my model. Household conditions depend on wages $W$, the interest rate $R$, dividends $D$, household transfers $\eta$, the tax level $\tau^L$, and tax progressivity $\tau^P$. Therefore, I can decompose the vector $d \mathbf{C}$ representing the linearized impulse response function (IRF) for consumption as 
% \[
%     d \mathbf{C} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{W}} d \mathbf{W} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{R}} d \mathbf{R} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{D}} d \mathbf{D} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{\eta}}{\partial \mathbf{\eta}} d \mathbf{\eta} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{\tau}^P} d \mathbf{\tau}^P + \frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{\tau}^L} d \mathbf{\tau}^L
% \]
% where $\frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{X}}$ is the direct effect of $X$ on consumption and $d \mathbf{X}$ is the IRF for $X$. For my analysis, I combine dividends and direct transfers since both are evenly distributed transfers to all households. I also combine the tax level and tax progressivity since tax level variation is almost entirely explained by changes in tax progressivity (Figure \ref{fig:agg-var-decomp}). Denoting transfers $T$ and taxes $\tau$, this means
% \[
%     d \mathbf{C} = \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{W}} d \mathbf{W}}_{\text{Wage effects}} + \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{R}} d \mathbf{R}}_{\text{Interest effects}} + \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{T}} d \mathbf{T}}_{\text{Transfer effects}} + \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{\tau}} d \mathbf{\tau}}_{\text{Tax effects}}.
% \]

% Then, denoting $\frac{\partial \mathbf{C}}{\partial \mathbf{X}} d \mathbf{X}$ as $d \mathbf{C}_X$, variance in consumption within the model can be explained as
% \begin{align*}
%     \Var\left(d \mathbf{C}\right) &= \Var\left(d \mathbf{C}_W\right) + \Var\left(d \mathbf{C}_R\right) + \Var\left(d \mathbf{C}_T\right) + \Var\left(d \mathbf{C}_\tau\right) \\
%     & \quad\quad + 2 \Cov \left(d \mathbf{C}_W, d \mathbf{C}_R\right) + 2 \Cov \left(d \mathbf{C}_W, d \mathbf{C}_T\right) + 2 \Cov \left(d \mathbf{C}_W, d \mathbf{C}_\tau\right) \\
%     & \quad\quad + 2 \Cov \left(d \mathbf{C}_R, d \mathbf{C}_T\right) + 2 \Cov \left(d \mathbf{C}_R, d \mathbf{C}_\tau\right) \\
%     & \quad\quad + 2 \Cov \left(d \mathbf{C}_T, d \mathbf{C}_\tau\right).
% \end{align*}
% Unlike the variance decompositions in Section \ref{sec:buis-cycs}, this features covariance terms. This is because the shocks to the model decomposed in Section \ref{sec:buis-cycs} are assumed to be orthogonal to each other, while direct effects within the model are not. Positive covariance within the decomposition implies comovement between the decomposed effects that complement each other. Negative covariance implies comovement between decomposed effects that, in part, cancel each other out. Substituting in any other household variable for consumption, including the policy rules at specific states, results in an identical decomposition. 


\subsection{Decomposition Results}

% I perform this decomposition on aggregates and decision rules for consumption, labor supply, and savings. Like in section \ref{subsec:buis-dec-rules}, I decompose decision rules at the 10th, 50th, and 90th productivity percentiles and the 50th, 90th, and 99th wealth percentiles. Appendix \ref{app:dec-rules} decomposes the IRFs for household behavior into each direct channel.

\begin{table}[t]
    \centering
    \caption{Direct Effects Decomposition: Consumption}
    \include{tables/c_dir_decomp}
    \label{tab:c-dir-decomp}
\end{table}

% Table \ref{tab:c-dir-decomp} presents the decomposition results for consumption. Across all productivity levels, the variance explained by the interest rate relative to the other variances is higher for households at the 99th wealth percentile. Wages and transfers explain more variance in consumption for households with lower wealth levels. For low productivity households, transfers are more important and for high productivity households, wages are more important. Interestingly, relative to other factors, changes in the interest rate explain more of the variance in consumption for low wealth, high productivity households than high wealth, low productivity households. This suggests the effects of the interest rate comes from precautionary channels, which would impact the high-productivity net savers more, rather than income channels, which would affect higher wealth households more. Negative comovements between the effects of wages and transfers cancel each other out, especially for low productivity households.

% The results for the decomposition of labor supply is presented in Table \ref{tab:l-dir-decomp}. Across all wealth and productivity levels, the amount of variation explained by transfers is larger than the variation explained by wages. This suggests that income effects from direct transfers dominate within the model, though the negative covariance between the two factors suggests substitution effects dampen income effects. Like with consumption, interest rates explain more of the variance for higher wealth and higher productivity households relative to the amount of variance explained by the other factors. Similar to consumption, likely due to precautionary motives, interest rates explain the majority of variation in labor supply for high productivity households. Middle productivity households face wage, tax, and transfer effects with massive negative covariances suggesting the consumption effects of aggregate trends for this group cancel each other out.

\begin{table}[t]
    \centering
    \caption{Direct Effects Decomposition: Savings}
    \include{tables/b_dir_decomp}
    \label{tab:b-dir-decomp}
\end{table}

% The decomposition for savings is presented in Table \ref{tab:b-dir-decomp}. Like in Figure \ref{fig:hh-var-decomp}, borrowing constrained 50th wealth percentile households in the low and middle productivity groups have no variation in savings during business cycles. Variation in savings for 90th and 99th wealth percentile households in these groups is almost entirely explained by the interest rate. For high productivity households, the interest rate still explains most of the variance in savings, though significant portions are also explained by wages and taxes. These likely play a larger role for high productivity households compared to low productivity ones since earnings from wages and taxes paid increase with productivity, especially given the progressive taxation scheme. High productivity households also face significant negative covariance between interest rates and wages and interest rates and taxation, suggesting these explanatory factors move against each other.
