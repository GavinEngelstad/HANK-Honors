\subsection{Aggregate Outcomes}

Using the estimated shock parameters, I examine the role of each shock within business cycles. Figure \ref{fig:agg-var-decomp} features a forecast error variance decomposition for key aggregates in the model.\footnote{See Appendix \ref{app:fevd} for how the forecast error variance decomposition was calculated.} Panel \ref{subfig:gen-aggs} describes how output and inflation are affected by different business cycle shocks. Compared to other literature, I find TFP plays a smaller role in my model, especially in explaining output variance \autocites{smets2007shocks}{bayer2024shocks}. I find that price and wage markups are important business cycle drivers in the model, and play a much larger role explaining changes in output than seen in \textcite{bayer2024shocks}. This difference is likely explained by the lack of a capital sector in the economy causing changes in firm behavior to be explained by price, not production, factors. Consistent with other estimates, supply-side factors (TFP and price/wage markups) account for about 80\% of output volatility, suggesting my estimated TFP, price markup, and wage markup shocks act as general supply side shocks, including the investment shock seen in \textcite{bayer2024shocks}. Government spending, tax progressivity, and transfers have an important effect on prices (inflation) in the model but not output.

Panel \ref{subfig:hh-dec-aggs} explores how business cycles affect the factors that directly impact household decisions. Variance in the amount of labor supplied by each household is mostly explained by price and wage markups. Price markups also play an important role determining the wages and dividends paid out to households. Monetary policy shocks explain the largest share of interest rate variance, and tax progressivity shocks explain almost all variance in the tax level. Altogether, TFP and government spending shocks have a relatively small effect on the factors that impact households. Therefore, price markups affect households income and labor supply while wage markups only significantly impact the amount of labor households supply. Monetary policy primarily affects the interest rate and tax progressivity primarily affects the tax level. Government transfers have a small but non-negligible effect across the board.

A variance decomposition of household aggregates is presented in Panel \ref{subfig:hh-agg-aggs}. Price and wage markups have the largest impacts on consumption, suggesting the union's labor supply choice, wages, and dividends are important factors to the household's consumption decisions. In contrast, household bond holdings are mostly affected by government spending, monetary policy, and transfers. Since government spending, the interest rate, and transfers play into the government bond law of motion, this suggests household reactions to the supply side of the market is most important explaining variation in aggregate household savings.


\subsection{Decision Rules} \label{subsec:buis-dec-rules}

Next, I examine the business cycle factors that drive changes in household behavior at different points along the income and wealth distribution. I focus on the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles on the productivity distribution. Since labor is supplied homogeneously across households, these represent low, middle, and high income households. On the wealth distribution, I look at the 0th, 50th, 90th, and 99th percentiles. Over 40\% of the households in the model hold 0 savings, so the decision rules for the 0th percentile apply to a significant portion of households. The 50th, 90th and 99th percentiles represent households that have small, medium, and large savings respectively. I look at the decision rules at fixed points on the wealth distribution. This means the analysis does not apply to specific individuals in the model, who can move along the distribution, or account for shifts in the distribution changing the threshold for wealth percentiles.

Table \ref{tab:ss-dists} gives information about the decision rules and income sources at these productivity and wealth levels in the steady state. Both consumption and savings, as expected, are increasing with both productivity and wealth. Consumption increases more between income than wealth shares while savings increases more between wealth than income shares. This suggests higher wealth households exhibit significant consumption smoothing over time attempting to save more to be able to maintain slightly higher levels of consumption, however higher income households count on having a more sustained income to be able to consumption smooth. Despite this, within the model there exists precautionary saving from high income households to protect against idiosyncratic income shocks since, unlike low and middle income households, high income households at all but the highest wealth levels are net savers and end the period with more assets than they start with.

\begin{table}[t]
    \centering
    \caption{Household Steady State Behavior}
    \include{tables/distribution}
    \label{tab:ss-dists}
\end{table}

Households at different points along the income and wealth distribution get their budget each period from different sources. For low income households, transfers and, at higher wealth levels, interest rates contribute significantly to their budget. In contrast, higher income households get a significantly larger share from their wages. Because of the progressive tax structure, higher income households contribute a significantly higher share of their income to taxes. For a more detailed breakdown, see Appendix \ref{app:dec-rules} for surface plots of household decision rules (Figure \ref{fig:hh-pol-rules}) and income sources (Figure \ref{fig:hh-income}) at all wealth and productivity levels.

Within business cycles, the shock determinants of household behavior exhibit significant variability across the wealth and income distribution. Figure \ref{fig:hh-var-decomp} gives a forecast error variance decomposition for household decision rules for consumption and savings at different productivity and wealth levels. Appendix \ref{app:dec-rules} also features IRFs for each decision rule in response to each shock at all income and wealth levels.

    \label{fig:hh-var-decomp}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:hh-var-decomp}, changes in consumption for low income households are best explained by wage markup shocks while changes in consumption for high income households are best explained by price markup shocks. Given the decompositions for household decision determinants in Figure \ref{subfig:hh-agg-aggs}, low income households are highly responsive to changes in the labor supply decided by the unions while higher income households respond more to changes in the level of wages and dividends. Interestingly, tax progressivity and transfers have more significant effects on the decision rules for household consumption at all wealth and income levels than on aggregate consumption. This suggests the consumption effects of tax progressivity and transfers for different households cancel each other out, making the shocks less important in aggregate. This emphasizes the heterogeneous effects that macroeconomic shocks can have on different households and the importance of understanding the disaggregated effects of macroeconomic events.

The variance decompositions of household savings decisions also vary across the wealth and income distributions. Low and middle income households that hold no wealth never choose to save, so they have no variance explained within the model. Monetary policy shocks affect already high wealth households far more than any other group, suggesting the effect of interest rate hikes can be explained more through income effects, which only affect households that already hold wealth, than households choosing to save because of the higher potential gains, which would affect all households. Government spending and transfer shocks explain the most variance for high income households, suggesting increases in government spending and transfers, which the government funds through offering more bonds to households, are primarily funded by higher income households, though transfers are also important to middle and low income households with median wealth levels. Again, tax progressivity shocks play a more significant role explaining individual rather than aggregate savings, meaning household responses to the shocks cancel each other out.

Similar to the steady states in Table \ref{tab:ss-dists}, variance decompositions of household consumption vary more between income levels than wealth levels while variance decompositions for household savings vary more between wealth levels than income levels. This means heterogeneity in household decisions depends on the distribution of households states and the decision being made, suggesting more complex models where households make more decisions could exhibit more complex types of heterogeneity.
