#### To-Do
In no particular order:
- Computational sensitivity appendix
- Better calibration
    - $\tau^P$ was arbitrary
    - $\rho_z$ and $\sigma_z$ is based on a paper with unions, so matching the distribution relies on fixed labor supply across households
- Fix tax rule (to follow paper)
- Better interpretations (contextualize with other papers)
