# HANK-Honors
Hey!

This contains replication files for my Economics Honors project at Macalester College. The project explores the magnitude and transmission channels of heterogeneous effects of business cycle shocks on household decisions within a HANK framework.

Within the repo, you'll find:
| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Paper | The .tex files for the paper. To compile these (why) run the figures notebooks first. |
| Toolkit | A class-based toolkit I wrote to solve and estimate heterogeneous models based on the method presented in Auclert et al. "Using the Sequence-Space Jacobian to Solve and Estimate Heterogeneous-Agent Models." |
| Models | An example Krusell-Smith model for testing and the HANK in the paper using the toolkit |
| Notebooks | Notebooks to fetch data, run models, and replicate the paper |

If you have any questions, send me an email at [gengelst@macalester.edu](mailto:gengelst@macalester.edu)!
